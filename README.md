# Community Library

Your local coffee shop has a community library where anyone can borrow books from it. Visitors can also donate books by checking them in with the employees. The problem? Book loans are not being tracked, so it's hard to know if a book is available. Also, the library uses the honor system so books are returned at the borrower's leisure. Your task is to create a Web Application that allows coffee shop customers to loan and return books. It should also allow coffee shop employees to add new books to the library as well as remove books that have been lost.
